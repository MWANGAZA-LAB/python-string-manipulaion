Python String Algorithms and Utilities

A collection of simple yet powerful Python programs demonstrating various string manipulation techniques and classic algorithms. This repository is part of my journey in mastering programming fundamentals with real-world mini projects.

Projects Included

Luhn Algorithm
Validates credit card numbers using the Luhn checksum formula. Commonly used in fraud detection and verification systems.

- Input: Card number
- Output: Valid or invalid status

2. Case Converter
Converts text input to:
- UPPERCASE
- lowercase
- Title Case
- Sentence case

3. String Cipher (Encryption)
Implements a basic cipher to obfuscate input text. Great for learning character manipulation and ASCII transformations.

4. String Decryption
Reverses the encryption logic from the cipher script to retrieve the original text.

 Purpose

These scripts were created for practice and learning purposes. They focus on:
- String manipulation
- Algorithm design
- Input validation
- ASCII and Unicode handling

Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Standard Libraries only (no external dependencies)
